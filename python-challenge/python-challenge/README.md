# python-challenge
Homework 3 assignment
Coding examples were used from class lectures as many of the topics covered there mimicked the setup for this challenge. I also watched conversation of other students asking questions in the slack. Some in-class challenges that were specifically used as examples:
- readcomicbooks
- student census zip
- house of pies
- ins_writecsv
- ins_zipper

For the writing files command, which wasn't covered in class specifically, I used this StackOverflow answer:

I found this article that helped me address specific decimal handling in python:

I used this page to ready up more on math expressions in python:
